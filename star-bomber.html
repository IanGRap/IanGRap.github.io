          Star Bomber is one of the first games I made and my first experience with Unity. It is a turned based shoot 'em up with color based mechanics. During the defensive stage, the player must change the color of their ship to match incoming projectiles while dodging white colored attacks. During the attack, the player must fire projectiles that match the color of pieces of the boss and the color of the super meter at the bottom of the screen. By doing so, they can charge up their special attack to defeat the boss.
          <br>
          I've always really liked shoot 'em ups but have always found them too difficult. I added the turn based mechanic so that the player doesn't have to focus on shooting and doding at the same time. I've also found color based mechanics like those seen in Ikaruga to be really easy for players to quickly grasp while adding another layer of depth to movement.
