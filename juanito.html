          Juanito is a senior captsone project for the Game Design program at University of California Santa Cruz that I assisted on during my junior year of school. It is a story focused puzzle game about a boy on a journey to discover his family heritage. The puzzles involve either using the games spirit mode to direct animals to clear obstacles or pulling and rotating objects around the environment.
          <br>
          As a programmer, I worked on the games first act where the player must push a medicine crate to a pharmacy. I programmed the physics and pushing/pulling mechanics for the medicine crate, added collisions for the pulley system that the player uses to move the crate up floors and programmed the lever that activates the pulley once both lifts have been loaded. I also made multiple protypes for the butterfly puzzle in the games second act, where the player moves stone pieces in the shape of a butterfly to proceed.
