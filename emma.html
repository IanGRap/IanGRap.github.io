          Emma's journey is a graduate student game made at the University of California Santa Cruz that I assisted on during my Sophmore year of school. It is a branching narrative game where the player assumes the role of Emma and follows her as she works to combat climate change. It was made for the web using StoryAssembler: a JSON based program made in the UCSC graduate school and used for making narrative games.
          <br><br>
          I worked primarily as a writer, barinstorming and writing dialogue for scenes in the game. I would then write the dialogue into the StoryAssembler program, connecting logic, assigning variables and providing feedback for my teammates that were working specifically on StoryAssembler. I wrote large portions of the dinner, dean and UN scenes in the game, but also assisted with and revised all the game's scenes.
