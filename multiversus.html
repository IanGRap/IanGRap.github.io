          I am a game designer working at Player First Games on the free to play platform fighter Multiversus. Multiversus just launched in Open Beta in August, and has already reached 20 million unique players! As a designer, I own the designs for fighters, emphasizing clarity, authenticity, novelty, cooperative play and engaging loops. In particular, I am the lead designer for Garnet from Steven Universe, Taz from Looney Tunes, as well as unannounced upcoming fighters. I've also made substantial contributions designing mechanics for Arya from Game of Thrones and Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. Some of my primary responsibilities include creating pitch documents for fighters, collaborating daily with animators, implementing frame data on fighter attack animations, and writing and debugging mechanics through Unreal blueprints for server based online play. I also led the design on our casual focused free for all game mode, created move lists for our characters, participate in daily playtests, assist with debugging all of our cast of characters and even participated in press interview in the build up to our release.
