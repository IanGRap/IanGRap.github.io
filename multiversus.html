			  I worked as a game designer at Player First Games on the free to play platform fighter Multiversus. As a designer, I owned the designs for fighters, emphasizing clarity, authenticity, novelty, cooperative play and engaging loops. In particular, I was the lead designer for Aquaman from DC, Samurai Jack, Agent Smith from The Matrix, Marvin the Martian and Taz from Looney Tunes, Garnet from Steven Universe, as well as unreleased fighters. Some of my primary responsibilities included writing and debugging character mechanics through Unreal blueprints, creating pitch documents for fighters, collaborating daily with animators, implementing frame data on fighter attack animations and participating in daily playtests. I also led the redesign of our perks system, helped script content for the PVE Rifts mode and even participated in press interviews in the build up to our release and character launches.

				<p class="character-description">Aquaman was my first experience working in a mentorship role with an associate designer. As a mentor, it was important for me to provide my fellow designer plenty of space to explore their ideas for attacks and mechanics while making sure they stayed aligned on the core pillars for the character.</p>
				<p class="character-description">We designed Aquaman to be very ground focused, with powerful summons and multi-hitting attacks he can utilize while on the ground. In particular, his shark and seahorse summons are some of the hardest hitting attacks in the game.</p>
				<p class="character-description">The rest of his kit is largely focused around reeling foes to the ground for powerful finishers. His pufferfish summon floats overhead to pressure airborne enemies, while his octopus summon is a great option for grabbing overhead opponents. While in the air, Aquaman can use grabs on his neutral normal and down special to pull and throw foes toward the platform and his army of sea creatures.</p>

			<div class="col-9">
				<p class="character-description">As our first samurai in the game, I knew Jack would be popular with players regardless of their familiarity with his source material. As such, I designed his kit to be accessible and a great first choice for new players. His various sword slashes and hits were all designed to hit enemies in a direction that allows for various viable follow up attacks, even if they don’t lead to true combos.</p>
				<p class="character-description">His passive ability is Focus, which grants him empowered versions of his special attacks after filling his focus meter. His meter fills by both dealing and taking damage, making it easy for players to fill without even considering it. Once full, players only have a short period of time to use a Focus Special or else they will forfeit it, encouraging them to rush down their opponent instead of camping while empowered.</p>
				<p class="character-description">Camping and projectile spam had been prominent issues in MultiVersus while Jack was in development, so I wanted to design him with a melee focus (minimal projectiles) and anti-projectile tools. For example, his Lightning Reflex special allows him to grab incoming projectiles and throw them back at his opponent. His Blade of Vengeance special puts him into an armored state before his attack. If hit during his wind up, Jack unleashes a sword slash projectile that would lock in on the foe that struck him.</p>

			<div class="col-9">
				<p class="character-description">I designed Smith to embody the Gun-Fu identity often associated with The Matrix, directing his kit around more close range encounters. After all, Agents don’t snipe, they charge their opponents like an unstoppable force. It was important that Smith’s gun felt more like a melee weapon than a ranged one, and I made the decision to have his pistol shoot short-range, shotgun-like blasts instead of traditional projectiles.</p>
				<p class="character-description">I also wanted the player to weave in between gunshots and martial arts moves, so I made the decision to have his melee attacks be the most efficient way to refill his ammo. Melee attacks refill his ammo meter while his gun attacks will unload all available ammo in multiple shots. The result is that gun attacks are powerful finishing options at the end of a combo string, but the player is disincentivized from spamming dsijointed gun attacks to keep distance from enemies.</p>

				<b class="bullets-on-background">Marvin the Martian</b>
			</div>
			<div class="col-9">
				<p class="character-description">I designed Marvin’s kit around using his gadgets to create powerful projectile synergies with his team. For example, his bubble projectile from his ACME Bubble Blaster attack will envelope any projectile it collides with then continue moving. This creates a powerful double projectile where both projectiles hit when the bubble collides with an enemy. Marvin’s flag from his ...In The Name of Mars special creates an area that debuffs overlapping enemies, causing all nearby projectiles to lock onto them. His K-62 Projectile Modulator special will reverse the horizontal movement direction of all of Marvin and his ally’s projectiles, making it a great option to catch enemies off guard after they dodged an incoming rocket.</p>
				<p class="character-description">Each of these options boost projectile play heavily on their own, but used in tandem can overwhelm opponents as Marvin orchestrates a bullet-hell-like assault. While he is a more challenging character to pick up, Marvin offers some of the most unique mechanics in the game and lots of power for players that master his kit.</p>

					<b>Taz the Tasmanian Devil</b>
				</div>
				<p class="character-description">I designed Taz to be both a very accessible and hyper aggressive character. He also turns enemies into chickens! His various food themed attacks apply a Tasty debuff to enemies. After applying the debuff, the player needs to hit their foe a certain number of times in a brief window to transform them into a chicken. Taz’s Taz-Nado and Dogpile! Dogpile! specials are both attacks that hit at least three times, making them great options to use on a Tasty enemy.</p>
				<p class="character-description">Enemies that get turned into chickens will be unable to attack and drop healing pick ups when hit, offering another great incentive for Taz to stay aggressive through healing and staying in the fight a bit longer. With the multiple options for applying Tasty and landing multi-hits, it is very accessible for more casual players to button-mash and still succeed at turning enemies into chickens.</p>

					<b class="bullets-on-background">Garnet</b>
				</div>
				<p class="character-description">While big punches make up much of Garnet’s kit, I also wanted to include her singing, electrical powers and future vision from the Steven Universe show into her mechanics. As a result, her gameplay involves proper trap placement just as much as it does heavy hits. Her Spark of Love special allows her to attach an electrical trap to the arena which will buff her team before detonating and hitting overlapping enemies. Her Gem Dash special lets her place a marker at her location in the arena, then use the ability again to dash back to the marker and pull enemies she encounters along the way with her. When these abilities are used together, Garnet can place her electrical trap and marker next to each other, then use Gem Dash to pull enemies back to her trap just in time for it to detonate!</p>
				<p class="character-description">Her Stronger Than You special grants her a speed boost while stopping incoming projectiles and her Rocket Fist! special gives her a projectile with controllable movement. These abilities both give her ways to close gaps with her enemies and set her up for success with her Spark of Love and Gem Dash.</p>
