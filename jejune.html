          Jejune is a narrative based puzzle game where the player must fit a group of children into a grid, making sure that all adjacent children get along with one another. The story follows the kids at a costume party where they turn the political debates they overhear their parents fighting over into settings for their fantasy adventure. 
          <br><br>
          As a programmer, I built the grid based board that the characters are on, character movement across the board and worked with my partner on both the stat sidebars that display character personality traits and implementing cutscenes. For design, I pitched the original idea of the personality based grid puzzle as well as the stat bars that display character traits.
